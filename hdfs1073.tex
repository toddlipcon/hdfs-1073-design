\section{Storage contents}

The NN storage directories continue to be organized in the same way - either edits, images, or both. The difference is that each edits or {\tt fsimage} file now has a suffix indicating its "roll index". For example, a newly formatted NN has the following contents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt fsimage\_0} - empty image
\item {\tt edits\_0\_inprogress} - the edit log currently being appended
\end{enumerate}

When edits are rolled, the current {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} file is ``finalized'' by renaming to simply {\tt edits\_N}. So, if we roll the edits of the above image, we end up with:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt fsimage\_0} - same empty image
\item {\tt edits\_0} - any edits made before the roll
\item {\tt edits\_1\_inprogress} - the edit log currently being appended
\end{enumerate}

When an image is saved or uploaded via a checkpoint, the validity rule is as follows: any {\tt fsimage} with roll index N must incorporate all edits from logs with a roll index less than N. So, if we enter safe mode and call {\tt saveNamespace} on the above example, we end up with:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\tt fsimage\_0} - original empty imagge
\item  {\tt edits\_0} - edits before first roll
\item  {\tt edits\_1} - edits before {\tt saveNamespace}
\item  {\tt fsimage\_2} - all edits from {\tt edits\_0} and {\tt edits\_1}
\item  {\tt edits\_2\_inprogress} - the edit log where new edits will be appended
\end{enumerate}

\section{Log Rolling}

\subsection{Triggers to roll logs}
The following events can trigger a log roll:

\begin{enumerate}
\item NN startup (see below)
\item {\tt saveNamespace}
\item a secondary or backup node wants to begin a checkpoint
\item an IOException has occurred on one of the current edit logs
\item potentially we may find it useful to expose this as an admin function? (eg mysql offers a {\tt FLUSH LOGS} command, useful for backups)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Log rolling process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The current {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} log is closed
\item The current {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} log is renamed to {\tt edits\_N} in all valid edits directories.
\item Any edits directories that previously had problems will be left with {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} (since we don't know whether all of the edits made it into that log before the roll, in fact they probably did not)
\item The next {\tt edits\_N+1\_inprogress} is opened in all directories, including an attempt to reopen any failed directories.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Startup behavior}

\subsection{Log recovery (primary NN)}\label{logrecovery}
First we initiate log recovery:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Across all edits directories, look for any {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress}.
  \item For each N for which we located {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Look for a finalized {\tt edits\_N} in any other log directory
    \item If there is at least one finalized {\tt edits\_N,} then the {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} is likely corrupt â€“ rename it to {\tt edits\_N\_corrupt} (or delete it if we are less cautious)
    \item If there are no finalized {\tt edits\_N} files, then the NN crashed while we were writing log index N. Initiate recovery process across all {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item  Currently this isn't fancy - I just pick one. However, we could scan each of the logs for OP\_INVALID and find the longest one, ensure that they have the same length, etc (eg one log must not have caught the last edit, or been truncated, etc)
      \item  This is very simple to do since across all directories (including secondaries) {\tt edits\_M} for any M should be identical!
      \item  After we've determined the correct log(s), finalize it and remove the others
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Log recovery (backup node)}\label{bnrecovery}

On the backup node, any {\tt inprogress} edits files must be removed, and later refetched from the primary NN.
These files are most likely truncated, since they indicate that the BN crashed while replicating the file, and the
primary NN may have flushed more edits since then.

\subsection{Image recovery}

Any {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_N} that exists is likely to be incomplete, as the {\tt \_ckpt} suffix indicates that the image is in progress of being written. Thus, we remove any of these images (or mark as .corrupt if we are feeling cautious)

\subsection{Namespace reconstruction}
\label{ns-reconstruction}
After performing the above recovery actions, we must determine which files to load in order to reconstruct the namespace.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the {\tt fsimage\_N} with the highest N across all image directories.
\item Then, find the {\tt edits\_M} with the highest M across all edits directories.
\item For safety, we check that there exists an {\tt edits\_X} for all X between N and M inclusive.
\end{enumerate}

We then start up the NN by the following sequence:
\begin{enumerate}
\item load {\tt fsimage\_N}
\item for each N through M inclusive, load {\tt edits\_N}
\item if we loaded any edits, save {\tt fsimage\_N+1}
\item open {\tt edits\_inprogress\_N+1}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Upgrade}

Upgrade processes are essentially unmodified, except that we must be sure that we can read the old layout ({\tt fsimage}, {\tt edits}, and {\tt edits.new}) in order to perform an upgrade. The changes described in this document change the layout only within the {\tt current/} directory and thus the management of {\tt previous} during upgrade rollback and finalization is unaffected.

{\bf Open question:} do we need to support upgrade from a namespace that was not cleanly shut down?

\section{saveNamespace process}

The process for the primary NN to save its own namespace is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item NN must be in safe mode (this quiesces any incoming edits to the namesystem)
\item NN rolls its own edit log - call the pre-roll log index $N$, so {\tt edits\_N} is finalized and {\tt edits\_N+1\_inprogress} just got opened.
\item NN saves its namespace into {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_N+1} in each edit directory.
\item NN renames {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_N+1} to {\tt fsimage\_N+1} in all edit directories.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Failure analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item If the NN crashes after rolling edit logs, the old edit log is finalized and the new index is in progress. Log recovery proceeds as in section \ref{logrecovery} on restart - the pre-roll logs are loaded as if there was no failure.
\item If the NN crashes while saving its namespace, image recovery will remove the incomplete {\tt ckpt} image.
\item If the NN crashes after it has renamed one more of the new images, it will recover from that image and correctly ignore the {\tt edits} files with lower roll indexes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Support for concurrent checkpoints}

If a secondary NN initiates a checkpoint while {\tt saveNamespace} is under way, the checkpoint will cause another edit log roll. Therefore, when the secondary uploads its checkpoint, it will have a different index number than the image being saved by {\tt saveNamespace} and not conflict in any way.

\section{Checkpoint process}
\label{2nn-checkpoint}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt CheckpointSignature} is modified to include the latest image index and the current log index in progress.
\item Checkpointing node issues {\tt beginCheckpoint} RPC to NN.
\item NN rolls edit logs, and returns a checkpoint signature that includes the index N of latest stored {\tt fsimage\_N}, as well as the index of the most recent finalized log file.
\item Image transfer servlet is augmented to allow the downloader to specify which image or edits file to download.
\item Checkpointer downloads {\tt fsimage\_N} and {\tt edits\_N} through {\tt edits\_M} (where M is the latest edit roll index, from the checkpoint signature)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When each file is downloaded, it is initially written to {\tt edits\_inprogress\_N} or {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_N} until it is verified. Once it is verified it can be renamed to the final destination {\tt edits\_N} or {\tt fsimage\_N}.
  \end{itemize}
 
\item Checkpointer saves local {\tt fsimage\_M+1}, and uploads to NN
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Similar to above, when the NN receives a new fsimage, it initially saves it as {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_N} until the upload is complete. This prevents an aborted checkpoint from causing a corrupt storage directory.
  \end{itemize}
\item NN validation of the checkpoint signature is much simpler - just needs to make sure it came from the same filesystem, check any security tokens, etc. The old fstime and editstime constructs are no longer necessary since it's all encapsulated in the index numbers. For extra safety we can easily add some checksum or log length info to the CheckpointSignature
\item NN saves {\tt fsimage\_M+1} into its local image dirs, but does not need to do any log manipulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Handling multiple secondary name nodes}

Note that in the above process there is no state stored on the NN with regard to ongoing checkpoint processes. If multiple checkpoint nodes checkpoint simultaneously, the NN will simply roll twice and hand a different index to each. Each will then upload fsimages with different indexes.


\section{BackupNode operation}

The BackupNode operation is substantially simplified by this new design. 

\subsection{BackupNode state}

The BN maintains the following pieces of state:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt journalState} - an enum, either {\tt IN\_SYNC} or {\tt JOURNAL}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt IN\_SYNC} specifies that the BN's namespace is currently up to date with the primary NN, and any edits received should be immediately applied to the namespace, in addition to being logged to disk.
  \item {\tt JOURNAL} specifies that the BN's namespace is currently behind the primary NN, and edits should only be written to disk.
  \end{itemize}
\item {\tt namesystemReflectsLogsThrough} - the index of the last log for which the BN has completely applied edits.
\item {\tt currentReceivingLog} - the index of the log that we're currently receiving from the primary NN
\item {\tt stopApplyingAtNextRoll} - a boolean allowing the checkpoint code to pause application of edit records (see section \ref{stopApplyingAtNextRoll})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{BackupNode Startup}

On startup, the BackupNode first performs storage recovery as described in section \ref{bnrecovery}.
It will then proceed with namespace reconstruction (see section \ref{ns-reconstruction}) in the same manner as if it were a primary NN.

When startup is complete, The {\tt namesystemReflectsLogsThrough} variable will be up to date with the index of the latest log or image that the BN has recovered.

The BN then registers itself with the primary NN, which begins sending it edits. Upon registration, the NN rolls its edit log and begins streaming edits to the BN with the new log index.

The BN starts out in {\tt JOURNAL} mode, since it is not up to date with the current NN. In order to attain synchronization after startup, it may call {\tt catchupSynchronization} (see section \ref{catchupSynchronization}).

\subsection{Receiving edits}

Once registered, the NN streams all edits to the BN via RPC as in the existing design.

\subsubsection{Special edit records}

In addition to sending namesystem edits to the BN, the NN will also send a special {\tt OP\_ROLL\_LOGS} record which indicates that the primary NN has rolled its logs to a new index. This record includes the new index of the edit logs, so that the BN can update the {\tt currentReceivingLog} variable and roll its own logs. Additionally, if the flag {\tt stopApplyingAtNextRoll} this record will transition from {\tt IN\_SYNC} to {\tt JOURNAL} mode.\label{stopApplyingAtNextRoll}

\subsubsection{Applying and journaling edits}

Depending on the current {\tt journalState}, the BN takes different actions for each edit.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the state is {\tt IN\_SYNC} then the edit is immediately applied to the namesystem, and also written to disk.
\item If the state is {\tt JOURNAL} then the edit is only written to disk.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Checkpointing}

In order to make a checkpoint, the BN takes the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set {\tt stopApplyingAtNextRoll} flag.
\item Ask NN to {\tt beginCheckpoint}, which rolls logs - this triggers {\tt OP\_ROLL\_LOGS} which pushes us to {\tt JOURNAL} state.
\item We assert that BN's logs are now rolled and we are in {\tt JOURNAL} state. As in section \ref{2nn-checkpoint} we receive the index of the newly finalized edits log from the master as a response to {\tt beginCheckpoint}.
\item If BN was previously {\tt IN\_SYNC} then we should already be up to date with the NN. If BN was not {\tt IN\_SYNC} then we download and apply edit logs between {\tt namesystemReflectsLogsThrough} and the index referenced by the {\tt CheckpointSignature}.
\item Checkpoint image is uploaded as in section \ref{2nn-checkpoint}.
\item {\tt catchupSynchronization} is called (see section \ref{catchupSynchronization}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Converging logs}

After a checkpoint, we are in the {\tt JOURNAL} state and need to ``catch back up'' to the primary NN. The algorithm to do so is in pseudocode:
\label{catchupSynchronization}
\begin{verbatim}
def catchupSynchronization():
  assert we are in JOURNAL state
  assert currentReceivingLog != -1  [ ie that NN is sending us edits and we are journaling them ]
  converged = false
  while namesystemReflectsLogsThrough <= currentReceivingLog:
    if namesystemReflectsLogsThrough < currentReceivingLog:
      # we're still catching up on finalized logs
      fetchAndReplayLogIndex(namesystemReflectsLogsThrough + 1)
    else:
      converged = tryConverge(namesystemReflectsLogsThrough + 1)
  assert mode == IN_SYNC

def tryConverge(N):
  open current edits_N_inprogress that is being written to
  if the open fails due to FNFE:
    assert that edits_N exists [ie it got rolled before we opened it]
    return False

  replay logs until EOF
  lock journal
  if currentReceivingLog > N:
    # we rolled while replaying, go back to catchup sequence
    unlock journal
    assert that edits_N exists (ie that our open file got finalized under us)
    continue to replay logs from same open stream until EOF
    namesystemReflectsLogsThrough = N
    return False [we did not succeed in converging]

  assert currentReceivingLog == N
  replay last logs in edits_N_inprogress until another EOF
  set state = IN_SYNC
  namesystemReflectsLogsThrough = N
  unlock journal
  return True
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Handling multiple BNs}

In the above design, the BN never assumes that the NN will be stop rolling for any period of time. All checkpoint operations are stateless with respect to the server. If multiple BNs start checkpoints separately, they will checkpoint different roll indexes, and upload fsimage files with different indexes as well.

\section{Image/edits file retention policies}

There are a number of policies that should be simple to implement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Number of saved images} - ensure that we have at least N saved images in our image directories, can delete any that are more than N versions old. Maintain edit lots that have index $>=$ the index of the Nth oldest image.
\item {\bf Time} - ensure that we maintain all images within a trailing time window - again maintain all edit logs with index $>=$ index of oldest maintained image.
\item {\bf Archival} - for audit purposes, the deletion mechanism could very easily be augmented to archive the edit logs for later analysis (eg to HDFS, tape, SAN, etc)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Directions}

Although we do not plan to implement the following ideas within the scope of this issue, we want to be confident that the design does not preclude implementation in the future. Here are brief sketches for some suggested future directions:

\subsection{NN-triggered checkpointing}

Rather than having the BN trigger checkpoints on a periodic basis, it would be very simple to modify the design so that the BN triggers checkpoints based on a special flag on {\tt OP\_ROLL\_EDITS}.

\subsection{Offline Checkpointing}

Rather than having a special daemon to perform checkpointing, it may be nice to have an offline tool that, given a storage directory, can perform a checkpoint for that directory.

This can be done as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the {\tt fsimage\_N} with the highest N
\item Read any {\tt edits\_M} for $M >= N$.
\item Save {\tt fsimage\_M} into the same directory.
\end{enumerate}

Note that this will not checkpoint the current {\tt edits\_inprogress} if an NN is currently running in this directory. If we want an uptodate checkpoint, we can trigger the NN to roll - this is very simple, and could be done through a new {\tt dfsadmin -rollEdits} command.

In order to prevent collisions with other checkpointers, we need exclusive write access to the {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_M} file while we write it. This is easy to achieve on most filesystems using advisory locking. Alternatively, checkpointers could checkpoint into uniquely named {\tt fsimage\_ckpt\_M\_<GUID>} files to avoid overlap, and then atomically rename the checkpoints into place when complete.

\subsection{Shared storage for metadata}

One of the primary advantages to the design in this document is that for any finalized edits or image file name, the contents of that file should be exactly identical across an entire cluster, including NNs, 2NNs, or BNs. In the current design, the primary and backup nodes communicate only by transfering complete files back and forth. For example, {\tt edits\_3} on the NN is fetched into the same name {\tt edits\_3} on the BN or 2NN.

  To switch to a shared storage directory, the {\tt TransferFsImage} calls would essentially be replaced by no-ops. The BN would be modified to tail the current {\tt edits\_inprogress} file from the shared edits directory, and the NN can simply write the {\tt OP\_LOG\_ROLL} record into the end of that file when it has completed it. When the BN encounters this record, it simply opens the next log file in sequence to continue tailing edits.

\section{Sequential vs Transaction-numbered edits}

This document proposes that edit logs and images are numbered sequentially, with the first file being {\tt \{edits,image\}\_0} and proceeding to {\tt \_1}, {\tt \_2}, etc. An alternative design that has been proposed is to keep a transaction ID for each edit performed to the namesystem. The files would then be numbered as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt fsimage\_T} indicates that the transaction with id $T$ was the {\em last} transaction applied to the namesystem before the image was saved.
\item {\tt edits\_T} indicates that the {\em first} transaction stored in this edit log will have id $T$.
\end{itemize}


\section{Test Plan}

\subsection{Existing Unit Tests}

The following unit tests already exist and will be modified to respect the new storage layout:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt TestBackupNode}
\item {\tt TestCheckpoint}
\item {\tt TestEditLog}
\item {\tt TestEditLogRace}
\item {\tt TestNameEditsConfigs}
\item {\tt TestSaveNamespace}
\item {\tt TestSecurityTokenEditLog}
\item {\tt TestStartup}
\item {\tt TestStorageRestore}
\end{itemize}

These unit tests cover the majority of basic functionality of this feature, as well as regression tests for bugs found in the old implementation.

Some unit tests will have additional test cases.

\subsubsection{TestCheckpoint}

A new test case will be added to show that multiple checkpoints can be taken from multiple CNs with no interference.

\subsubsection{TestBackupNode}

A new test case will be added to show that multiple BackupNodes can run at the same time against the same NN with no interference.

\subsection{New Unit Tests}

\subsubsection{TestEditLogRecovery}

The first case ensures that the NN will recover from edit logs that are found spread across several directories.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a NameNode with 3 storage directories
\item Alternate between making some edits and rolling logs, such that each storage directory contains {\tt edits\_0} through {\tt edits\_10}
\item Stop the NN
\item In each directory, delete a non-overlapping set of edit logs, such that the first directory contains {\tt edits\_0}, {\tt edits\_3}, etc.\ and the second directory contains {\tt edits\_1}, {\tt edits\_4}, etc.
\item Start the NN and verify that all edits have been restored.
\item Verify that a new image file has been saved with the correct index.
\end{enumerate}

The second test ensures that the NN will properly discard {\tt edits\_N\_inprogress} files:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a NameNode with 3 storage directories
\item Alternate between making some edits and rolling logs, such that each storage directory contains {\tt edits\_0} through {\tt edits\_10}
\item Stop the NN
\item In each directory, corrupt a non-overlapping set of edit files by renaming them to have the {\tt \_inprogress} suffix and then overwriting them with random data.
\item Start the NN and verify that all edits have been restored, and the corrupted files have been renamed to {\tt edits\_N\_corrupt}
\item Verify that a new image file has been saved with the correct index.
\end{enumerate}

The third test ensures that if the last edits file is in progress, it will be finalized at startup.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a NameNode with 3 storage directories
\item Alternate between making some edits and rolling logs, such that each storage directory contains {\tt edits\_0} through {\tt edits\_10}
\item Assert that the last edit file is named with an {\tt \_inprogress} suffix.
\item Start the NN and verify that all edits have been restored, and that the last log was finalized.
\item Verify that a new image file has been saved with the correct index.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{BackupNode Stress Test}

This is a stress test that can be implemented in a JUnit fixture and either run as part of the unit tests or run manually.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start a NN and two BNs connected to it, each configured to make checkpoints several times per second.
\item In several threads, make edits to the NN as fast as possible
\item Let the system run for as many minutes as desired. While it is running, the following faults can be injected:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A storage directory becomes temporarily inaccessible on either the NN or a BN (eg manually chmod 000)
  \item A BN crashes and restarts
  \item The network between the NN and BN fails.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Stop system
\item Verify across all storage directories the following invariant: if there exists a file with name $f$, and the file does not have an {\tt \_inprogress} or {\tt \_ckpt} suffix, then it must have an identical SHA1 checksum to all other files with the same name across all nodes.
\end{enumerate}
